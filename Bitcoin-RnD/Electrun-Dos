TestNet:


	Step 1:
		Getting some Test bTC in my account
		Account addrr: mvMgYHxLC4j3A2iGz6Lf3AW1gVTURFfSxa

		Balance mBTc:
			+325.0
			+650.0
			Total 975.0 mBTC

			**To chnage unit in which electrum displays balamce:
				Tools-->Prefrence-->Appearance-->BaseUnit


	

	Step2:
		Trying to transfer 1 mBTC to one of my accounts :

		send to : mkjz22n7KPJbUrz39EnQyuAMM64kHbxGUE


		Input:
		82a09ba6...193034c1:0    mvMgYHxLC4j3A2iGz6Lf3AW1gVTURFfSxa      650.     

		Output:
		mkjz22n7KPJbUrz39EnQyuAMM64kHbxGUE	        1.     
		mxMtVM1z4T48SJnoRu7GVoV4QuC8gqYWd6	      648.846  

		Tx Id: 17fbdefed2b34b8abfd312d13f000aceec71e191d3841e51f877bc998c521fa2

		Failed..

		Solution: ***awesome**

		There are some issues with electrum testnet. Don't broadcaste the transaction from Electrum.
		Eneter the details under send tab.
		Click on preview instead pf send.
		Click on copy.
		Now you should be able to broadcast it via sites like this: https://testnet.blockexplorer.com/tx/send#!

 Q: Why you cannot enter an arbitrary seed in Electrum
 A:
	Electrum does not let you use an arbitrary sequence of words as seed. This is because humans are not good at generating really random phrases. 

	The seed generated by Electrum is a 128-bit random number. It is encoded as a sequence of 12 words, for the purpose of memorization. However, it is important to understand that it has 128-bits of entropy. A phrase generated by a human, or picked from a random book opened at a random page, will in general be much less random, and much more vulnerable to attacks. (and "much more" here means astronomically more).

	In this type of attack, time is on the side of the attacker. It is perfectly possible for an attacker to try all the phrases existing in a large database of books, and some variants of those, until they find a wallet. In contrast, it is not possible to do the same with 2^128 random phrases.

	As you may have noticed, it is possible to bypass this protection; if you restore your wallet from a hexadecimal string, any string length will be accepted. However, this will only work with hexadecimal inputs. Thus, if you absolutely insist on using an arbitrary phrase as seed, you will need to hex-encode it yourself. Consider this as a protection.
